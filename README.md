## Hey, I'm Michael Hsu! ðŸ‘‹
Check out some of my projects below.

## PowerShell Projects

### [ADUserAccountTools](https://github.com/mcyhsu/ADUserAccountTools)
**This script contains cmdlets that help you create, enable, disable, or remove AD user accounts in bulk.**

Use the appropriate cmdlet on a CSV/TXT file containing AD user account information and it will apply that action to all of the specified accounts.

### [YTPlaylistBackup-PS](https://github.com/mcyhsu/YTPlaylistBackup-PS)
**This script backs up YouTube playlist details to CSV files.**

If videos in your music playlist get deleted or set to private with no indication of which ones, this script makes it much easier for you to replace the inaccessible videos.

### [SpotifyPlaylistBackup-PS](https://github.com/mcyhsu/SpotifyPlaylistBackup-PS)

**This script backs up Spotify playlist details to CSV files.**

If songs in your playlist get removed with no indication of which ones, this script makes it much easier for you to determine which songs got removed so you can replace them.
